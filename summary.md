## Introduction
In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002,
it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud. In the
resulting Federal investigation, a significant amount of typically confidential
 information entered into the public record, including tens of thousands of
 emails and detailed financial data for top executives.
 In this project, I built machine learning algorithms to identify Enron
 Employees who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and
  email dataset.

## Data exploration
The aggregated Enron email & financial dataset is stored in a dictionary,
where each key in the dictionary is a personâ€™s name and the value is a
dictionary containing all the features of that person. Dictionary is stored as
a pickle file, which is the format of the data source of this analysis. A
summary of the dataset is as follows:
1. Total number of people (data points) is 146.
2. For each person, there are 21 features available.
3. Total number of POI (person of interest) is 18.
4. Total number of POI on the email list is 35.

Questions to answer:
allocation across classes (POI/non-POI)
number of features used
are there features with many missing values? etc.
